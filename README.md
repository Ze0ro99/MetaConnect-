# MetaConnect

MetaConnect is an application that integrates the metaverse and virtual reality, supporting various digital payment methods. This project is developed voluntarily by private developers for the Pi Network and contributors to enhance this application.

## Developer Information
- **Developer Name**: Ze0ro99
- **Email**: kamelkadah910@gmail.com

## Features

- **Secure Login**: Options for social media login.
- **Personal Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for managing user settings.
- **Instant Messaging**: Text, voice, and video chat capabilities.
- **File Sharing**: Support for sharing multiple file types.
- **Calendar and Task Management**: Integrated calendar to track events.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Alerts for new messages and updates.
- **Integration with Other Apps**: Support for integration with Google Drive and Dropbox.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Reports on system usage and team performance.
- **Multi-language Support**: User interface available in several languages.
- **Security and Privacy**: Advanced security features to protect user data.

## Blockchain Technology

The backend of MetaConnect utilizes blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in transactions. Key features of the blockchain integration include:

- **Decentralization**: By leveraging blockchain, user data and transactions are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the risk of data breaches and ensuring users have more control over their information.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated contracts that execute when predefined conditions are met, allowing for secure and efficient transactions without the need for intermediaries.
- **Digital Payments**: Support for various cryptocurrencies, enabling users to make transactions seamlessly within the application.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail that enhances trust among users.

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**
- **MongoDB**
- **Blockchain Network**: (Specify the blockchain platform used, e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file (create it if it doesn't exist) with the required configurations such as:
   - MongoDB connection string
   - API keys
   - Blockchain network credentials
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

### Running the Application
After setting up both frontend and backend, you can start the application. Make sure both servers are running simultaneously.

### Steps to Implement
1. Open your project in a text editor.
2. Create or edit the `README.md` file and add the content above.
3. Save the changes.
4. Commit and push the changes to the repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with blockchain technology details"
git push origin main
```
## Installation and Usage

### Setting up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
    ```

### Installing Required Libraries
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Connecting to Pi Network
3. Use the following script to connect to the Pi Network:
    ```python
    from stellar_sdk import Server

    try:
        server = Server(horizon_url="https://api.testnet.minepi.com")
        response = server.ledgers().limit(1).order(desc=True).call()
        print("Connected to Pi Network Testnet!")
        print("Latest Ledger Sequence:", response["_embedded"]["records"][0]["sequence"])
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to connect to the testnet:", str(e))
    ```

### Sending Transactions on Pi Network
4. Use the following script to send transactions:
    ```python
    from stellar_sdk import Keypair, TransactionBuilder, Network, Server

    def send_transaction(private_key_sender, public_key_receiver, amount):
        server = Server("https://api.testnet.minepi.com")
        sender_keypair = Keypair.from_secret(private_key_sender)
        sender_account = server.load_account(account_id=sender_keypair.public_key)

        base_fee = server.fetch_base_fee()
        transaction = TransactionBuilder(
            source_account=sender_account,
            network_passphrase=Network.TESTNET_PASSPHRASE,
            base_fee=base_fee
        ).add_text_memo("Test Transaction").append_payment_op(
            destination=public_key_receiver,
            amount=str(amount),
            asset_code="Pi"
        ).build()

        transaction.sign(sender_keypair)
        response = server.submit_transaction(transaction)
        print("Transaction successful! Hash:", response["hash"])

    # Example usage
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        send_transaction("PRIVATE_KEY_SENDER", "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 10)
    ```

### Running Automated Tests with Pytest
5. Use the following script for automated testing with Pytest:
    ```python
    from stellar_sdk import Server
    import pytest

    def test_connection():
        server = Server("https://api.testnet.minepi.com")
        response = server.ledgers().limit(1).order(desc=True).call()
        assert "sequence" in response["_embedded"]["records"][0]

    def test_send_transaction(mocker):
        mocker.patch('send_transaction', return_value={"hash": "dummy_hash"})
        response = send_transaction("PRIVATE_KEY_SENDER", "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX", 10)
        assert response["hash"] == "dummy_hash"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        pytest.main()
    ```
